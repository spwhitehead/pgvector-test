[Music] welcome to the standard of Truth podcast in this podcast Dr Garrett durkot and Professor Richard luk explore the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the life and teachings of Prophet Joseph Smith they examine the original historical sources and provide context for events of the past they approach the history of the church with faith expertise and humor [Music] hi welcome to another episode of the standard of Truth podcast I'm your host Dr Garrett derkm and I'm joined by my friend Professor Richard luk hello Garrett in this week's podcast we're going to get back to Witnesses of the Book of Mormon we think we we are we have one email to read and the email that we are going to read leads into I feel like over the last several weeks Richard has deliberate baited and switched things he's I think this is all part of his plan to take over the podcast actually what he wants to do is send me down so many tangents that people are like I I just don't know where we can get any discussion on the witnesses and then Richard will swoop in with his podcast it'll be called the gold standard of Truth H yeah and then and then he talk about about 70s Nixon policies on the gold stand all it'll be all about whether or not Roosevelt takes uh takes us off the gold standard during the Great Depression well so now this this one now you know it's serious because instead of just calling it The the Phoebe Draper mailbag this is the Phoebe Draper Palmer Brown mailbag and that means we're getting down to business we're super focused okay using all of her names so it's it's kind of like you know you know it's if you use a middle initial in the church that's how you know someone's got a big calling that's true or when my wife says or when I say the middle name of our child it's because they're in a tremendous amount of trouble yeah it's Phoebe Draper Palmer Brown mailbag subject line ban Sunday content that's a good way to start yeah did is that why we decided to read it because we like oh what can't you say on church on Sunday um Dear Professor Richard L Duke and Dr Garrett damont as one of your many listeners gifted a premium subscription as a Christmas present shortly before the free trial option became available I have since consumed the entirety of your 2023 premium content over the course of January my wife an Avid Reader who read 170 plus novels in 2023 mostly of the spicy romance variety oh that's not bad I haven't written I I haven't written I haven't you haven't written any novels lately I have not I have not or written them like a horse is that what you're I haven't ever I haven't taken a novel out of the bar you know up on the track that's true um I have not read a fiction book since Scarlet Letter in 10th Grade put me off all fiction books wow well is it just because of the Puritan calvinistic it's Nathaniel Hawthorne ruined literature for me and I I will never go back I read a lot of non-fiction but uh fiction it is funny that uh people are always asking me what are you reading because they assume oh you must be reading a lot the reality is when you're doing a ton of researching and writing like the the last thing you want to do to relax is to read you're like well what are you doing I read all day long well well what do you like read for fun fun doesn't exist I just do what do you mean fun you know we so we haven't talked actually about uh some of the research stuff you're doing but on on the on the Joseph Smith legal papers there's all kinds of I mean you can't talk about a lot of it I'm sure but probably not but there's all kinds of really cool stuff that you're finding through this through this research yeah yeah so we're spending uh you know spending a lot of time doing that you know and and trying to to help people better understand jesness legal troubles and yet you you learn new things you find new sources you you you come up with with uh interesting arguments that suddenly make things fit together and and it is wildly uh you know it it it there is a sense of accomplishment right so you feel that sense of accomplishment but at the same time it's exhausting and so yeah now when you finish you're not like well it's the weekend I I'll bet I could just go you know read rise and fall the Roman Empire it's probably going to be just oh here we go you know and you know Garrett you know what helps to take your mind off things on the weekend is going to a a live audience recording of the standard of Truth podcast oh boy um by the time that this this episode drops we'll actually have a location that will be uh sent out to those that have signed up for tickets and we're looking for forward to seeing you in about a week and a half yeah we have a very very generous um uh fan of the show who is offering us uh the use of of one of two different locations we're still not sure which one it will be but but we will know by the time this drops won't we yeah we will we probably shouldn't even have included that so now everyone listening is like it says right on my ticket the address what did you want me to tell you like someone emails dude on your ticket it says this well we're excited to see everybody that comes and uh we've got uh a fun evening planned I think we have about 2 hours or so planned of some wacky High Jinx plus uh the general goings on of a of a recording you're going to answer um some litner questions perhaps even on on polygamy perhaps uh on polygamy yeah well I mean we're not going to be recording that part but sure right yeah if we I don't I don't know that I'll be answering any polygamy questions at this point I'm not even sure that I'll be there I think Richard will be there with a cardboard cut out and then he it'll be it'll be like weekend at birdies kind of thing yeah we we did that uh we did that with h with a Brigham Young cardboard cutout we were in charge of activities for Trek one year and so we did a bunch of activities where he had to find Brigham Young the cardboard cut out of Brigham Young but he was I I I went a little cheap and went for the 4 foot version and so it was like it was like very small brigam yard like child siiz so one of the youth called it Shetland pony Brigham so Shetland Brigham which is kind of funny wow wow that's that's inter that youth is very uh what a very creative yeah very creative youth you have back to the Phoebe Draper Palmer Brown mailbag um so mostly spicy romance variety considers this to be of the retaliatory nature on the positive note two of our neglected children four and six have become quite proficient at fending for themselves during this media war and are now preparing meals assisting each other with homework and am and among other previously avoided tasks tasks among other previously avoided tasks as such we had a family Council to establish healthier limits on our media consumption and have determined to put aside our worldly Pursuits once a week to focus on the content aligned with come follow me curriculum such as follow him and scripture Central that's good advice by the way makes sense yeah yeah yeah you want to listen to better stuff that's Faith Yeah well yeah or anything that's not this since implementing this we did we did receive an email about somebody finding oh I think we read it about somebody somebody found follow him through this podcast and a friend of ours who works on the follow him podcast was stunned she responded they were they were like really like first of all anyone listens to you second of all what yeah uh U now look forward to Sunday as they call it Parents Day with enthusiasm I have only seen among Baptist congregationalists having now exhausted the available unplayed content in my standard of Truth playlist I have been returning to some of the earlier episodes to search for specific answers to some of the questions raised by some of my member friends who have recently distanced themselves from the church due to many false narratives in in uh circulation on anti-mormon subreddits in various podcasts extreme antim Mormonism that's right what about Sal body while I have been uh able to identify the source of many of the answers to their Myriad questions one that has so far eluded me is your commentary on the origins of the book of Abraham while I feel like the topic was covered at some point the complete lack of topic indexing has proven as reliable as Richard's weekly pick that is a shot that is hilarious I am hopeful you will be be able to direct me to appropriate episode so I can stay in accordance with President Gordon B hinkley's spring 2005 conference address on gambling he doesn't say that specifically but uh I added the additional context there to conclude this unintentionally long email I did have a question while listening to a recent episode you mentioned that not only did Martin Harris have in his possession possession possession an etching or drawing of some of the characters from the gold plates but that his wife also commissioned a copy of the document her daughter's hand as payment yes has both leverage these copies to their advantage it would seem reasonable to expect that they may have been approached by any of the local newspapers at the time interested in including the drawing in their publication do we know of any existing copies of these drawings I am sincerely grateful to both of you for your time and effort as you dedicate every week in building the kingdom of God in these miraculous times thank you for your faith expertise and humor your loyal weekly listener Dan Dan first of all I'm glad that your family had a family Council to figure out how to spend more time with your children and then that the main part of that was stop listening to this podcast yeah I feel like we should read more listeners letters who talk about their life getting better if they stop listening to the podcast you know it's could kind of be like we could turn into like a kind of like an alcoholic synonymous type of thing like hi my name is Dan I I haven't listened to standard podcast for 3 weeks yeah I was hey Dan Dan at your at your worst how much of the standard podcast were you listening to at my worst I was um I was putting money down on picks that Richard made uh weeks after the game was over that's where I was at at my worst I was listening for 23 hours a day I wasn't sleeping uh except when Garrett talked and then suddenly you know sleep would come uh but uh so I I appreciate the fact you found a healthy life balance but you know what your kids do need to learn how to cook and clean yeah seriously the world's not going to teach them yeah seriously my wife and I just watched some documentary on kids that uh are in Peru on Lake titty Kaka that that you know are on a boat made of reads that they Row for an hour and a half to school every day they's six I mean come on make yourself a sandwich hey you know what there's peanut butter there yeah you got a knife go for it um we haven't fully discussed um the book of Abraham on the podcast I mean we've we've made multiple references to it especially when we were talking about um modern scripture that Joe Smith has brought forth uh I think that there's a lot of different ways that people could uh talk about it one of the reasons why we haven't is that um I'm not an an expert in it I mean this will come as a surprise to people that I'm not an egyptologist um and also neither is Richard of the things he's getting at Oklahoma State one of them is not an egyptology degree it is it is not well and at this point it's a real not a business degree it's a real waste though because still water is known for their egyptology studies they they're known for beating BYU and basketball even though they shouldn't and also mullets and also egyptology those are the three in fact they're on their they're on their flag if you go to see an Oklahoma state flag it will say egyptology mullets we beat BYU in basketball and football and in you know what let's just stop talking about your Alma moer that beats B not my El Mo yet because I have a gradu true yeah you could drop out right now that's true that's the same reason why he's not rooting for BYU um so uh he didn't drop out of BYU he he he followed his love that's right to my wife with my wife to Utah State because she hated BYU yeah yeah and I I think still does oh very much so yes she's she's an Aggie through and through and but she did have uh her son inform her that that's where he's going yes yes our son Andrew will be going to BYU and it sounds like the other son also looking at some BYU stuff yes so we have uh we have some some nieces and nephews at BYU Hawaii and so I think he wants to follow them there so I think so at some point when none of them have gone to Utah State the true Aggie will die possible it's possible okay well so um it's not it's not my expertise although you know I certainly can talk all about Joseph Smith during that time period part of the problem with the book of Abraham is that everyone wants to talk about it but there's very little that we know about it now we all know the story of Joseph Smith getting the the the Papyrus Scrolls but when and how the translation takes place is frankly a great deal of speculation and that's part of the reason why it becomes very problematic to take an authoritative position on how was the book of Abra Abraham translated or what was in the Scrolls in part because we don't have the Scrolls so nearly all of the Scrolls that they obtained when they bought the Chandler mummies were destroyed we have very small fragments of them and in fact one of the times we did talk about them was that uh one of the things they did because the irus you know being several thousand years old is rather brittle and fragile and one of the ways that they tried to preserve the Papyrus this is probably from the Kirtland period is that they took uh already existing paper that they had because paper was very expensive and they they glued the Papyrus to this paper as a backing you you've probably seen people do that with books before right you you can you know a page that's really weak someone puts a a piece of paper in there and then that kind of gives it some stability and things like that um the reason why I know all about this is I was working on documents volume three of the Joseph Smith papers and as such we were talking about the original plans for building the Kirtland Temple and it is a reality that the paper that they decided to back pack the Papyrus fragments with were the original plans drawn up for the building of the Kirtland Temple so when you look at that document and it's on Joseph smithp papers. org when you look at that document when you look at the part of the existing Scrolls that we still have you can actually see drawn behind it the interior plans of the Kirtland Temple that they cut up and used as essentially scratch paper I mean they were probably like well we're already done with the temple why in the world would we need this anymore because they weren't thinking like historians you got to think like a historian anyway um so the reality is when someone says something definitively like well I know that there's no way that what's in the book of Abraham was in the original Scrolls well they actually don't know that because you don't have those Scrolls you can certainly say well I don't think so or this is what I hypothesize that's great but that's not the same thing as being definitive or knowing um and and secondly while we have all kinds of accounts of Joseph Missi translation of the Book of Mormon we have almost no accounts of Joseph's mistranslation of the book of Abraham and it takes place over the course of years it takes place over the course of years so it becomes highly problematic to try to be definitive about what did and didn't happen we know that by 1842 at least Wilfred Woodruff believes that Joseph Smith is using the the sear stones to translate the book of Abraham but even that doesn't tell us everything right because Joseph Smith has used sear Stones previously to receive doctrine of Covenant section 7 which is a scroll written uh you know a parchment written and hidden up by the Apostle John and Joseph doesn't even have that scroll in his possession and there are people on all sides of the argument who think that there's great evidence for the historicity and that there's other people on the other side of the argument who talk about how there's greater evidence for it being revelatory and the church and its gospel topics essay on the topic the the the book of Abraham tries to represent and present both of those views and and so I think that you know I I where it's not my field of expertise outside of Joseph Mist transation that I don't know that I'd be able to expand a whole lot on it so that's what I'd point you to uh when it comes to the book of Abraham now that wasn't your real question though well that was that I can't find it so our crack research staff did find in Joseph Smith papers and we'll have the link in the description uh it's actually hilarious you have you have the papus right there and they turn the back and they've got the Cur temp it's actually hilarious yeah I mean so of course one of the questions I had CU we were trying to get their exact dimensions of the Kirtland Temple layout can we like can we like look underneath the other side of the parchment of course you can't right so I mean yeah anyway but speaking of the Joe Smith papers um a as it relates to your second question we will also Richard if the crack research staff can get on it yes put a second link in to the largest extent characters document ah that is a an existing uh an existing characters document that shows characters drawn off of the gold plates to your specific question of did any local newspapers try to publish these we don't have any that we are aware of now In fairness to me saying that you know look there's always a caveat I'm a historian so every word I say will always be caveat because there's always a something it's not like we have complete runs of every single newspaper that existed in Upstate New York in the 1820s there's huge gaps everywhere for instance we know that Palmyra Freeman was very interested in Joseph Smith publishing the the gold Bible and is regularly going to attack that but we're missing many issues from the Palmyra Freeman because it was not a widely circulated paper and it eventually ceased publication not a lot of people said you know what I need I need a paper railing on masonry that I'll keep for my family's posterity long after the anti-masonic movement collapses and no longer exists finding people who were anti-masons in the 1870s is very similar to finding people who voted for Ross perau after Clinton was elected right we know a lot of people did it's pretty hard to find those people I think the number is 20% in Idaho can't find a person in Idaho 20% of the population voted for Ros proo you ask any Idaho and not one of them voted for Ros it's hilarious right it's like look guys statistically you are all of voting age you all say you voted at that election there's a hundred of you in here at least one of you did vote for him no not me I I no I don't know what you're talking I don't know who Ross BR is anyway um so those those P those those issues of the paper are not extent it's possible that some representation of the characters would have been published somewhere but we literally have no record of that now later when they are memorializing Joseph Smith after he is murdered the latterday Saint newspaper the prophet will in memorializing Joseph with its publication include some characters that are published with that Memorial but our our largest manuscript version probably the earliest of characters drawn off the plates actually um comes from most likely an 1831 document 18308 31 document um that for a long time people thought was the actual transcript that Martin Harris took to the you know people this was in the possession of of David Whitmer and and and was in the The Community of Christ archives and and it has a whole series of different uh you've seen it many times yeah and this is the one copied by John Whitmer in the right which is the reason why in fact this is one of the discoveries that Mike McKay and I made when we were at the Joseph Smith papers and that is that uh you know this is not um this couldn't possibly be the anthon transcript like the original one that Martin Harris took to Charles anthon because it's in John whitmer's handwriting and for those of us who are following Along on our chronology I know with joose Smith and the restoration we don't have one but um the other premium podcast um John Whitmer the Whitmer themselves are not even in the picture until after Martin Harris takes the characters to the east so Martin Harris takes the characters to the east in 1828 Joseph first meets the whiters after he's already been translating with Oliver and he moves to their house in June of 1829 so if John whitmer's handwriting is at the top of this paper which we'll have a link to that you can see these characters it couldn't possibly be the one that Martin Harris originally took as it relates to the fact that there were several of these characters circulating obviously there were some there's another Joseph Smith document in which there are a few characters from the gold plates that are written even with an interpretation of them but by and large there is not a uh there are not very many of these in circulation we know of none that were published by uh not contempor contemporary to the translation of the Book of Mormon maybe they didn't get their hands on it I mean one of the reasons why that might not have happened is remember Lucy got her copy because she was trying to show herself to be a big shot that she had copies of the characters of the plates well by publishing that in a newspaper you no longer are the exclusive person that people have to go to to see it so it actually makes sense why she wouldn't because her whole point in getting it is to make herself more important and that people had to come to her to see those characters well if I publish in a newspaper now no one has to come to me it makes sense why Martin Harris wouldn't publish them because he was already kind of in a little hot water because he wasn't able to hold on to things that he was supposed to hold on to so what was it what was it the Whitney called her the Wicked Witch of the restoration yeah the Wicked Witch of the the Wicked Witch of the restoration I believe Luc haris I mean it's very but somewhat on the nose um so we do have several different documents that have characters in them and we'll put a link to the earliest and the largest one that we have um and and we think probably drawn off in 1831 we think that uh John Whitmer uh he takes uh in 18 1830 he takes a a uh the winter of 1830-31 Joseph Smith sends John Whitmer to Ohio to meet with the saints that are there because uh he's heard reports that they are you know rolling on the floor and sailing in the ship to the lamanites preaching the gospel as we've talked about in a previous episode and so John Whitmer is going to go and try to you know make them more Orthodox and in doing so uh he takes several copies of the revelations with him and we think that that is where this copy comes from because it on the other part of this paper that's no longer extent it is a discussion of what is included you know it's kind of like it's a cover sheet for Revelations so that's what we think is going on um so it is very very very early but it's not the original and nor is it uh published in the papers did that yeah you nailed it all right well onto the Witnesses are we gonna actually do it we are okay all right here we go so we we introduced Doctrine and Covenant section 17 I don't know I don't know how many how many episodes ago Richard it was 2021 it was back before rker was born he's graduating from high school this year that's when we started talking about drct com section 17 that's true um he did and he just got into BYU there you go how about that BYU is making a huge showing in this podcast feel like BYU should sponsor this podcast I feel like they should I feel like people if they subscribe to the newsletter that's uh how how they can start and then we'll be able to show BYU hey look at all these followers that we have you really had a they won't care a whole lot yeah my guess is also not but you should still subscribe because that's how you find out the details about the live audience we need you to subscribe to the newsletter and then you can not only get a newsletter occasionally but also get some uh more information about things like our live event that I don't want to do but the Richard's forcing me to do because he's that kind of a friend that's right yeah um doctr government section 17 is received in a context that Joseph is going to provide for us um and so maybe I I will give you a little bit of that that context um he he's going to in the summer of 1829 things are actually looking a little bit much better than they did in the summer of 1828 there are first of all a lot more people that are starting to believe because of the whitmer's family the knights things like that um but also that they're even going to start doing baptisms right so they're going to start baptizing people there isn't a church okay but they do have the authority and so they're going to start performing baptisms in the manner that the The Book of Mormon uh takes place this is what Joseph Smith says many open their houses to us in order that we might have an opportunity of meeting with our friends for the purpose of instruction and explanation we met with many from time to time who were willing to hear us and Wishful to find out the truth as it is in Christ Jesus and apparently willing to obey the gospel when Once fairly convinced and satisfied in their own minds and in this same month of June my brother hyram Smith David Whitmer and Peter Whitmer Jr were baptized in senica Lake the two former by myself the latter by Oliver calary from this time forth many became Believers and were baptized and while we continue to instruct and persuade as many as applied for information so this things are are starting to look up a little bit right first of all they've already performed some baptism not just Oliver and Joseph you know you baptizing one another now there are others that have been baptized again even before there is a church in the course of the work of translation we ascertained that three special Witnesses were to be provided by the Lord so what he's talking about is this is June of 1829 so they are they are near the end of the translation of the Book of Mormon which again as we've talked about on here that would traditionally make us think oh so they're just jotting down you know moroni's last words and they're about to you know pray and ask God you know whether not these things be true that the wonderful promise of moronai but in fact they've already translated that because after the loss of the 116 Pages they translate through to the end of the large plates and then they go back around and translate the small plates and so some of the last things they translate are second Nephi you know Jacobus jeram Omni right and so it's in second Nephi as we already had talked about that the The Book of Mormon declares that there's going to be three Witnesses of the book ether had already mentioned that there were going to be Witnesses but now near the end of the translation it is reiterated again that there will be there will be uh three Witnesses of the book and so it's going to cause them to to to stop I mean it is really awesome honestly that that all throughout the translation of the book of Mormon what they get the information they get from the translation causes them to ask further questions of God who then gives them Revelations answering those questions you see this with Doctrine Covenant section 7 right well do you think John the Apostle is still living I don't know and then they receive Doctrine COV section 7 you see this with hey apparently you have to be baptized to go to heaven and you have to have authority to baptize how to the world do we get Authority well let's go ask God and boom you Reed the the the the the priesthoods restored through John the Baptist here again you have this uh something that's in the text of the Book of Mormon that Spurs the larger discussion heyy there's going to be Witnesses who are these Witnesses going to be Martin Harris has already been told by Revelation that he is going to be one Oliver cowry has already been told that he will be a special witness Again by revelation so let's go back to Joseph's account here he says we ascertain that three special Witnesses were to be provided by the Lord to whom he would grant that they should see the plates from which this work the Book of Mormon should be translated and that these Witnesses should bear record of the same as will be found recorded in the Book of Mormon so then you know gives because Joseph is writing his history in 1838 39 I mean referencing the original Book of Mormon where the Witnesses are are located in there um almost immediately after we had made this discovery it occurred to ol cowry David Whitmer and the aforementioned Martin Harris who had come to inquire after our progress in the work that they would have me inquire of the Lord to know if they might not obtain of him to be these three special Witnesses and finally they became very solicitous and teased me so much that at length I complied it one of the very frustrating in words of 19th century nomenclature that does not translate at all with where we're at is the word teased like I could see them pulling on Joseph's pigtails yeah they're they're they're they're uh they're saying hey Joseph didn't have anything other than a white shirt and brown pants huh you I me I don't know I don't know they're making fun of his clothes uh it it's an unfortunate thing because um it it really in it's in it's a digital you know it's 1828 version I we read to you from the dictionary um to Vex with importunity or impertinence now it can get to where we're at to harass annoy disturb or irritate by Petty requests or by justest and rry parents are often teased by their children into unreasonable compliances so the the better way that you would think about this term today is pester or wine right so when when you read teas in a 19th century it it doesn't mean like oh I'm only teasing no no it doesn't mean that it means that someone is persistently saying you know hey hey do you want to you want to go to McDonald's and and get something to eat hey man have you thought about maybe we could go to McDonald's you know I was thinking you know what I'm kind of hungry I'd love to go to McDonald's right now yeah I mean like the they they're essentially pestering uh to Vex with importunity this is what Jose is saying that once these guys caught a hold of the idea that they might possibly be the witnesses to this they did not let it go and began to tease me so much not saying hey Joseph you've got a big nose uh but saying can't can't we be why don't you ask why don't you ask I think at this point Joseph is a little hes didn't ask things like frankly every time you guys ask me for things it gets me in trouble I'm I'm going to just I'm just going to hold off a little bit maybe God will tell me when it's time but I we don't know that that's not in there but because because when I mean when he asks to take uh the the manuscript the his ability to translate was taken away because he asked because he kept asking yeah because are you sure Joseph are you like sure are you sure are you sure right so at this point Joseph is like ah I don't know I don't know why he hesitates but he says that at length so it sounds like it's a little while I complied and through the urum and Thum I obtained of the Lord for them the following Revelation and that Revelation as we talked about was Doctrine Covenant section 17 now we talked about that several witness episodes ago um which of course is not terribly helpful uh to everyone they've got to go back back and listen to it we talked about how some of the wording is probably a little bit different in what they saw the term yum and Thum because our earliest version we have is from from 1834 at any rate this is what they're told that if you rely upon my word uh you shall have a view of the plates and also of the breastplate the sword of laan the urum and Thum which were given to the brother of Jared upon the mount when he talked with the Lord face to face and the miraculous directors which were given to Lehi while in the wilderness on the borders of the Red Sea and it is by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them even by that Faith which was had by the prophets of old and after that you shall obtain have obtained faith and have seen them with your eyes you shall testify of them by the power of God and this you shall do that my servant Joseph Smith Jr may not be destroyed that I may bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men in this work so we got a couple of things that are there first of all they have to have faith before they can actually see them you get the list of the things they are going to see which is which is more than just the plates and very interestingly that the reason why God is calling these Witnesses is so that Joseph Smith may not be destroyed right so this this is clearly not just a hey we really like to see them type of thing the Lord has a special purpose in this which of course is prophetically uttered multiple times in the Book of Mormon itself uh and you shall testify that you have seen them even as my servant Joseph has seen them for it is by my power that he has that that he has seen them and it is because he had faith and he has translated the book even that part which I have commanded him as your lord and your God liveth it is true so here the Lord is bearing testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon wherefore you have received the same power and the same faith and the same gift like unto him and if you do these last Commandments of mine which I have given you the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against you for my grace is sufficient for you and you shall be lifted up at the last day and I Jesus Christ your lord and your God have spoken it unto you that I might bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men so think about this situation right here Joseph Smith has been translating The Book of Mormon for quite some time now with Oliver and and and Martin had translated with him before David Whitmer is not one of the scribes but he's it's in his house he's certainly present for it he provides he provides multiple accounts of the translation and then uh Joseph uh receives this Revelation in the same way that he was translating the gold plates so one of the first witnesses that these men get is Joseph receives this through the sear stones in the same way Joseph is translating the Lord now speaks to them as Joseph dictates these words off of the stone as part of this Revelation and of course then uh the the time has come you know that they're going they're going to get this this experience so they're told what they're going to see they're told they have to have faith first after the Revelation is included uh Joseph then explains what happens next not many days after the above commandment was received Doctrine COV section 17 we four Martin Harris David Whitmer all rowry myself agreed to retire into the woods and to try to obtain by fervent and humble prayer the Fulfillment of the promises given in this revelation that they should have a view of the plates we accordingly made choice of a piece of woods convenient to Mr whitmer's house so they're in fet they they go out outside of U of of Peter whitmer's Farmhouse there somewhere and we retired having knelt down we began to pray in much Faith to almighty God to bestow upon us a realization of those promises according to previous arrang ment I commence by a vocal prayer to our Heavenly Father and I was followed each by the rest in succession we did not yet however obtain any answer or manifestation of the Divine favor in our behalf we again observe the same order of prayer each calling on and praying fervently to God in rotation but with the same result as before now now think about this experience for a second you you feel like you have a revelation from God saying you can now see these things if you have Faith they make a determination okay it's time it's not like they just it's not like over cowry just wandered out into the Wilderness himself and said you know what I'm going to get to see those plates they all go together they all agree okay it's time we're going to go out we're going to pray they begin to pray and nothing happens I wonder what's going through Joseph's mind at this point because Joseph doesn't usually have to wait a whole lot of time based upon our previous interactions with the angel usually Jose was just like so anyway I was thinking and then moroni's there likey oh hey how's it going you know I mean he's getting these relatively quickly when he begins to pray and and here he doesn't have it so they go through they don't have it they they they decide that they're going to do it again they're each taking turns praying I don't know how long this is taking having read some 19th century prayers for all I know they're out there for hours praying you know as they each one is taking turns praying as they circle around and start going through it the second time we again observe the same order of prayer each calling on and praying fervently to God in rotation but with the same result as before upon this our second failure Martin Harris proposed that he would withdraw himself from us believing as he expressed himself that his presence was the cause of our not obtaining what we wished for he accordingly withdrew from us and we knelt down again and had not been many minutes engaged in prayer when presently we beheld A Light Above Us in the air of exceeding brightness and behold an angel stood before us in his hands he held the plates which we had been praying for these to have a view of now it's very odd phrasing uh he was holding the plates which we had been praying for these to have a view of is how it's written he turned over the leaves one by one so that we could see them and discern the Engravings thereon distinctly he addressed himself to David Whitmer and said David blessed is the Lord and He that keeps his Commandments when immediately afterwards we heard a voice from out of the bright light above us saying these plates have been revealed by the power of God and they have been translated by the power of God the translation of them which you have seen is correct and I command you to Bear record of what you now see and hear that's pretty powerful isn't it wow so I think we often don't we don't talk about that second portion of this experience so they're going to see first of all an angel and very interesting right that the angel only really addresses David Whitmer and I think this may be because uh Joseph and Oliver have already had Angelic visitations up to this point at least in this account David Whitmer hasn't maybe that's why or maybe it's just a response to the earlier Revelation to David Whitmer that he could be a witness if of of things it doesn't say of the plates but a witness of these things if he's faithful maybe that's what it is but blessed is he that keeps all the Commandments but they hear this voice speaking to them that the plates were revealed by the power of God that they were translated by the power of God and then the translation of them is correct and then they're commanded to Bear record so we all I I think all of us are very aware of this three witness experience and the fact that it didn't work out very well for Martin at first I think this is one of the more well-known stories in early church history so now the assumption is that's the voice of the Lord do any of them say that that's the case they'll say you know we heard a voice bearing record yeah but but whether or not it's the voice of the lord well let's let's go forward to see what they read here after we get through with Martin Harris I now left David and Oliver and went in pursuit of Martin so this is Joseph talking again who found at a considerable distance fervently I found at a consider fervently engaged in prayer he soon told me however that he had not yet prevailed with the Lord and earnestly requested me to join him in prayer that he might realize the same blessings that we had just received so I don't know what it was like for Martin Harris to to feel in your heart you know what I think it's I think it's my fault that we're not getting the answer to leave and to have Joseph come find you and apparently Joseph is telling him hey we just just we just it just happened you know hey just you know Martin you know don't want to make you feel bad or anything but yeah we totally just saw the plates and the angel came and but you know I'm sure it wasn't I'm sure I'm sure it had nothing to do with you I I obviously that's not part of the conversation and Martin has been wrestling with the Lord he's already been he's already feeling this pressure and yet still hasn't gotten to the point where he feels like he has he's overcome whatever wickedness he's trying to overcome but one of the cool parts of this story is what does Martin Harris say when Joseph walks up he doesn't say I can't believe that that you guys were able to see it and I wasn't or he doesn't say Joseph I don't even know I mean why can't why can't I see this um instead he asked Joseph to help him in his prayer to try to get right with God whenever I've read that it reminds me of the father in the New Testament who brings his son who's possessed by an evil spirit he brings his son to the apostles and the apostles fail to cast out the evil spirit now think about this you're you're a father whose son is is you know in all kinds of of of we we we read right it's terrible he's he's you know casts him into the fire it does all kinds of things to him and this evil spirit is constantly controlling him and then you hear by rumor you know you know that this guy Jesus him and his Apostles they're able to cast out evil spirits no no seriously we we know people that they've had evil spirits cast out no there's people cast out and so wherever this guy lives he makes a journey to where he knows that the apostles are with this this son who is in this uh you know this th this possessed State spiritually um to to go find Jesus and when he gets there he finds that Jesus has gone up the mountain Jesus isn't there but his Apostles are and he asked the apostles well clearly you've cast the evil spirits out before we we've heard all about it and the apostles go to cast out this spirit and it doesn't work where is the mind of this father now because he had already exercised Faith he had already exercised action he had already done what he thought he needed to do he believed that Jesus and his Apostles had the ability to do it he he traveled to wherever they were he besought them that they would do it the apostles certainly thought that they could and they didn't do it and the guy is is still there he doesn't leave he's still and Jesus comes down the mountain and he gets the explanation and when the Lord says to him all things are possible to them that believe the man says Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief and then Jesus heals his son and and and the evil spirit is driven from him and I often think of Martin Harris as being in the same kind of boat as that father was that instead of giving up all hope because the what you thought would happen Martin Harris turns to Joseph and says help me so that I can have the experience he turns toward the prophet instead of away from him I think that's a good thing applicably for all of us in our lives when things are not working out right and especially when things don't work out right when we are trying to do what we think is right to turn toward the prophet rather than away to instead of asking why can't I have what I want right now to start saying what can I do to bring myself in greater alignment with with the Lord's church I asked your question before whose voice they're hearing well um in in Doctrine com section 128 when Joseph writes a letter to the church later he talks about the experience what does he say that Moroni an angel from heaven declaring the fulfillments of the prophets the book to be revealed a voice of the Lord in the wilderness of fayet senica County declaring the three witnesses to Bear record of the book so while Joseph Smith's history is not specific about who's speaking from the light Joseph Smith in the letter that he writes to the church says that it is the voice of the Lord speaking to them um let's go back quickly to uh Joseph's account here with with we don't want to leave Martin Harris hanging we've already beaten up on Martin Harris enough Martin Harris is the he is the he's the the he's the the the punching bag of early church history um maybe that's what happens when you're married to the Wicked Witch of the restoration but um he requests that Joseph will will help him that he might realize the same blessings which he had just received and we joined in prayer and ultimately obtained our desires for before we had yet finished the same vision was open to our view at least it was again to me and I once more beheld and seen and heard the same things whilst at that the same moment Martin Harris Cried Out apparently in an ecstasy of Joy T enough T enough my mine eyes have beheld mine eyes have beheld and jumping up he shouted hosana blessing God and otherwise rejoiced exceedingly having thus through the mercy of God obtained these glorious manifestations it now remained for these three individuals to fulfill the Commandment which they had received to Bear record of these things in order to accomplish which they drew up and subscribed the following document so I I love that so I I actually feel many times like Martin Harris through much of my life and is he has been through a tremendous amount I can't imagine the joy he must feel having now actually seen this for the first time had to been incredible well and I mean I we don't know what's all going on inside Martin Harris's head you know we don't have Martin Harris's Journal he doesn't keep one or if he does we don't have it right um and of course he'll later talk about things but one of the things that people rarely talk about when they reminisce about their life is the times that they were sinful and not in communion with God you'll find that when people write autobiographies they don't spend a lot of time and look sometimes the autobiography is about like how I overcame drug addiction and so so that's all they talk about but usually when people are writing autobiographies uh in honor of their life they rarely say let me tell you the times where God was chastising me because I was just like way out there it's it's not a common thing for people to do and so we don't we don't have Martin Harris's Journal we only have reminiscent accounts and I've often wondered what is going on with Martin Harris at that point that he still isn't worthy without extra special help to have the angel come and appear I don't really know now I know that he lost 116 pages I get it and I know that that's a pretty big deal because he was trying to please men instead of God and that that he broke his Covenant I mean I realize there's a lot going on there but that also all happened more than a year earlier well a year earlier and since that time God has given other Revelations to Martin Harris like in March so several months earlier God has spoken to Martin Harris and maybe Martin is still struggling with that idea the fear of man the fear of of of going home to Lucy and and having to explain to her that he is still going to pay for the book well because because is it it's after this that he still hasn't paid for the so it actually puts it puts that section of do Covenant in Greater context you've seen this now what's your holdup and still hold up so Richard's referencing Doctrine Covenant section 19 um not to you know spoiler alert but uh eventually after the witnesses Witness the book of Mormon they are then going to begin negotiating with printers to try to find someone to print the book we know that they start doing that in roughly the same time period it's in June that they're going to publish the title page of the Book of Mormon in the in the Wayne Sentinel the EG edbert Gran's newspaper edbert granon has not agreed to publish it yet in fact he makes fun of it in his paper when he publishes it um but they're starting now to try to negotiate with printers and so Martin Harris has this amazing experience sometime near the end of June and then only a couple of months later when when he sees how steep that bill actually is going to be when he sees I said I'd pay for the Book of Mormon I didn't know it would cost me me everything he hesitates and Doctrine and Covenant section 19 is received telling him to stop coveting his property and impart a portion of thy property y even all say for the support of thy family to the printing of the Book of Mormon and so Martin is still going to be struggling I don't know what's going on before it it likely is that it's likely something to the effect of you know Luc has said you are not selling off our farm to pay for this gold Bible delusion um maybe it's more of her threatened lawsuits or legal actions for fraud against Joseph and against Martin in particular whatever it is Martin is still not in the right mindset but he gets there and and frankly yeah Martin is a lot easier to relate to in church history not because I have Wealth Beyond anyone you know I don't know what the equivalent of a his history Professor is in Joseph Smith's lifetime for income $300 a year yeah $300 a it's oh it's the same now they've just kept it steady that's appreciated um but Martin is pretty relatable because he makes all kinds of mistakes he's a Believer and yet sins he knows that Joseph is a prophet and then yet doubts how God's going to do the things God is going to do he believes that the gold plates really are from God but desperately wants his friends and family to agree that he's not crazy in a lot of ways Martin Harris is a pretty good example of all of us that rarely are we you know do we go from being a Sunday going you know everyday Orthodox latterday Saint to the next week you know doing the double axle 360s off the Mogul is an extreme anti-mormon right uh instead what usually happens is something by degrees we all sin even though we have a testimony and when we sin it's super frustrating because we have a testimony and hopefully the depth of that testimony is such that we seek back after the Lord to be forgiven so that we can once again make ourselves right with God Martin Harris is an inspiration in that regard because while he makes many many many mistakes he also repents he also desperately believes in the Book of Mormon while he's influenced by by people from the outside he also is willing to testify of the truthfulness of the Gospel even when people are mocking him and making fun of it for making fun of him for it in a lot of way a lot of Believers today in the world find themselves in the same position where they have a testimony but they know the moment they begin to share that testimony the whole world is going to come crashing down on them friends will will make fun of you and ostracize you family members will say well I don't want to even talk to you anymore if you believe this financial realities might become more difficult but Martin Harris in the end is going to be faithful to that and we'll talk more about uh the things he said about this experience in our next episode so I'm glad we finally got to this Richard I I think we deserve a gold star we
